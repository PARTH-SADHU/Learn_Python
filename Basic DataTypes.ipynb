    "#### 2-Float:Any real number that has a floating point representation in which a fractional component is denoted by a decimal symbol .\n",
    "#### 3-Complex number:A number with a real and imaginary component represented as x+yj. x and y are floats and j is -1.\n",
    "#### 4-Boolean:Data with one of the two built in values True or False.(NOTE- T AND F must be capital compulsory).\n",
    "#### 5-Sequence type-An ordered collection of similar or different data types.\n",
    "#### 6-String :A string value is a collection of one or more characters put in a single, double or triple quote.\n",
    "#### 7-List:A list is an ordered collection of one or more data items ,not necessarily of the same type , put in a square brackets.\n",
    "#### 8-Tuple:collection of one or more data items ,not necessarily of the same type , put in a square parentheses.\n",

    "#### 10-type() function:Python has in built function type() to ascertain the data type of certain value.\n",
    "#### 11-Mutable and Immutable Objects:Stored in the computers memory for processing .Number values, strings and tuples are immutable ,which means that their content  cant be altered after creation.On the otherhand ,collection of the items in a List or Dictionary object can be modified.It is possible to add,delete,insert and rearrange items in alist or dict whcih makes them mutable objects.\n",
